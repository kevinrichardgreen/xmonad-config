# Configure PATH so that we can access our scripts below

# Clear xmonad.state before starting xmonad -- otherwise this causes weird
# issues, especially when going between single screen and multi-screen
rm -f ~/.xmonad/xmonad.state

# Run the gnome-keyring-daemon to avoid issues you otherwise may encounter
# when using gnome applications which expect access to the keyring, such
# as Empathy. This prevents prompts you may otherwise get for invalid
# certificates and the like.
gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=gpg,pkcs11,secrets,ssh

# Configure X
xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr &
xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults &
